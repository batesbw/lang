- [ ] Develop a suite of integration tests (using `pytest`).
- [ ] Tests should cover the full lifecycle for different types of Flows (simple, with logic, etc.).

### New Agent Development

#### Task 3.2.1: `ApexGeneratorAgent`
**Priority**: Low | **Estimated Time**: 15-20 hours
- [ ] Scoping and implementation of an agent that can write general-purpose Apex classes.

#### Task 3.2.2: `LWCBuilderAgent`
**Priority**: Low | **Estimated Time**: 20-25 hours
- [ ] Scoping and implementation of an agent that can build Lightning Web Components.

#### Task 3.2.3: `DatabaseDesigner` Agent (Salesforce Grantmaking Specialization)
**Priority**: Low | **Estimated Time**: 25-35 hours

##### **Sub-Task 3.2.3.1: Research and Knowledge Gathering**
**Priority**: Low | **Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours
- [ ] **Action**: Use `WebSearchAgent` or external research to gather detailed documentation on the Salesforce Grants Management data model.
- [ ] **Action**: Identify all standard objects, custom objects, fields, and relationships that are part of the managed package.
- [ ] **Action**: Collect best practices for extending the Grants Management data model.
- [ ] **Deliverable**: Create a structured knowledge base (e.g., Markdown files, text files) that can be vectorized for a RAG tool. Store this in `documentation/salesforce_grantmaking/`.

##### **Sub-Task 3.2.3.2: Define `DatabaseDesigner` Agent Interface & State**
**Priority**: Low | **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
- [ ] **Input**: Natural language requirements for data model changes (e.g., "We need to track the impact of each grant with key metrics.").
- [ ] **Output**: A list of proposed changes (new objects, new fields, new relationships) in a structured format (e.g., JSON or Pydantic models). The output should specify if it's using a standard or custom element.
- [ ] **State**: `data_model_requirements`, `existing_standard_objects`, `proposed_changes`.

##### **Sub-Task 3.2.3.3: Implement `SalesforceSchemaReaderTool`**
**Priority**: Low | **Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
- [ ] **Action**: Create a new tool that can connect to a Salesforce org and read its schema.
- [ ] **Capabilities**:
    - List all standard and custom objects.
    - Describe a specific object (fields, data types, relationships).
- [ ] **Purpose**: This allows the agent to understand the *current* state of the org's data model before suggesting changes.

##### **Sub-Task 3.2.3.4: Implement `GrantmakingRAGTool`**
**Priority**: Low | **Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
- [ ] **Action**: Create a RAG tool that uses the knowledge base from Task 3.2.3.1.
- [ ] **Purpose**: The agent will use this tool to answer questions like "What is the standard object for tracking grant applications?" or "What is the best way to model grant budgets?". This promotes using standard features first.

##### **Sub-Task 3.2.3.5: Build `DatabaseDesigner` Agent (Grantmaking)**
**Priority**: Low | **Estimated Time**: 8-10 hours
- [ ] **Action**: Create `database_designer_agent.py`.
- [ ] **Prompts**: Design prompts that guide the LLM to:
    1.  First, understand the user's requirement.
    2.  Use the `GrantmakingRAGTool` to see if a standard object/field in the Grantmaking solution can meet the requirement.
    3.  If not, use the `SalesforceSchemaReaderTool` to check for other relevant standard objects in the org.
    4.  Only as a last resort, propose creating new custom objects or fields.
    5.  The agent should "think" step-by-step and justify its recommendations (e.g., "I suggest adding a new field 'ImpactScore__c' to the 'GrantApplication__c' object because...").
- [ ] **Orchestration**: Initially, this agent can be run standalone. Integration into the main LangGraph orchestrator can be a future step (e.g., the `FlowBuilderAgent` could consult the `DatabaseDesigner` if it detects a missing field).

- [ ] Analyze high-quality traces in LangSmith.
- [ ] Experiment with fine-tuning a model on specific sub-tasks (e.g., XML repair, user story parsing).

## Cross-Cutting Concerns (Ongoing throughout phases)

### Task CC.1: Security
- [ ] Secure storage and handling of all credentials (Salesforce, API keys).

### Task CC.2: Testing (Unit & Integration)
- [ ] Develop unit tests for each tool's logic.
- [ ] Develop integration tests for individual agents (agent + its tools).
- [ ] Develop end-to-end tests for LangGraph workflows using mock Salesforce responses where appropriate.

### Task CC.3: Documentation
- [ ] Document each agent's capabilities, input/output schema, and tools.
- [ ] Document the LangGraph workflows and state management.
- [ ] Maintain a clear `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.
- [ ] Document LangSmith usage for debugging and monitoring this specific project.

### Task CC.4: Configuration Management
- [ ] Manage configurations for different Salesforce environments (e.g., dev, UAT, prod - if agent is ever used for prod).
- [ ] Configuration for agent behavior (e.g., LLM model choices, temperature settings).
