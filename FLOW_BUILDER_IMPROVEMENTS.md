# Flow Builder Agent Improvements

## Problem
The Flow Builder Agent was making the same mistakes repeatedly during retry attempts:
1. **Invalid element references** - Using `Get_Contact_Count.Count` instead of `Get_Contact_Count`
2. **Collection variable misuse** - Using collection variables in `inputAssignments` which is not allowed
3. **Poor learning from failures** - Not effectively incorporating deployment error context into retry attempts

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt (`enhanced_flow_builder_agent.py`)
Added critical Salesforce Flow restrictions to the system prompt:

```
CRITICAL SALESFORCE FLOW RESTRICTIONS:
1. COLLECTION VARIABLES:
   - Collection variables CANNOT be used directly in inputAssignments
   - Use Assignment elements to add items to collections
   - In Get Records, use outputReference for the collection variable
   - In Create/Update Records, reference the collection variable directly as the input
   - NEVER use collection variables in individual field assignments

2. ELEMENT REFERENCES:
   - All element references must point to actual elements that exist in the flow
   - Element names are case-sensitive and must match exactly
   - Use proper syntax: elementName.fieldName or elementName.variableName
   - For Get Records elements, reference the count using: elementName (not elementName.Count)
```

### 2. Improved Error Analysis (`main_orchestrator.py`)
Enhanced `_analyze_deployment_error()` function with:

- **Specific error type detection** for common issues
- **Actionable reasoning prompts** for the LLM
- **Specific fixes needed** that directly address deployment errors
- **Pattern-based error classification** to improve learning

### 3. Better Memory Management (`enhanced_flow_builder_agent.py`)
Added deployment result tracking:

- `update_memory_with_deployment_result()` method to track deployment failures
- Memory now stores specific deployment errors, not just validation errors
- Failed patterns are extracted from deployment errors for future learning
- Memory is updated in `record_build_deploy_cycle()` to capture deployment results

### 4. Enhanced Retry Context (`main_orchestrator.py`)
Improved retry preparation:

- `specific_fixes_needed` field passed through retry context
- More detailed error analysis with pattern detection
- Specific guidance for common error types (collection variables, element references)
- Web search insights integrated into retry context

### 5. Specific Error Type Handling

#### Collection Variable Errors
```python
analysis["specific_fixes_needed"] = [
    "Remove all collection variable references from inputAssignments elements",
    "Use individual record variables for field assignments instead of collections",
    "If counting records, reference the collection variable directly (not in assignments)",
    "Ensure Get Records uses outputReference for collection, not inputAssignments"
]
```

#### Invalid Element Reference Errors
```python
# Detects patterns like "Get_Contact_Count.Count" and suggests fixes
if ".Count" in invalid_ref:
    analysis["specific_fixes_needed"].append(
        f"Remove '.Count' suffix - reference the element directly as '{invalid_ref.replace('.Count', '')}'"
    )
```

### 6. Enhanced Prompt Generation
Updated `generate_enhanced_prompt()` to include:

- Specific fixes section with actionable instructions
- Critical warnings about common Salesforce Flow restrictions
- Error analysis results directly in the prompt
- Memory context from previous failed attempts

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Reduced Repeated Mistakes**: Specific restrictions in system prompt should prevent collection variable and element reference errors
2. **Better Learning**: Memory system now tracks deployment failures and applies lessons to future attempts
3. **More Targeted Fixes**: Specific fixes needed are generated for each error type and passed to the LLM
4. **Improved Retry Success Rate**: Enhanced error analysis and web search integration should lead to better retry outcomes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Monitor Deployment Errors**: Check if the same error types occur repeatedly
2. **Verify Memory Updates**: Ensure memory is being updated with deployment results
3. **Review Generated XML**: Check that specific fixes are being applied in retry attempts
4. **Track Success Rates**: Measure improvement in deployment success on retry attempts

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/agents/enhanced_flow_builder_agent.py` - System prompt, memory management
- `src/main_orchestrator.py` - Error analysis, retry context, memory updates
- All error types now include `specific_fixes_needed` field

### Key Functions Added/Modified
- `update_memory_with_deployment_result()` - Track deployment failures in memory
- `_analyze_deployment_error()` - Enhanced error classification and specific fixes
- `generate_enhanced_prompt()` - Include specific fixes in LLM prompt
- `record_build_deploy_cycle()` - Update memory with deployment results
