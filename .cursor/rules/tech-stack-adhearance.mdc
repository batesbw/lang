# Rule: Technology Stack Adherence

## 1. Core Technology Stack

This project will primarily utilize the following technology stack. All development and implementation should prioritize these tools and frameworks:

- **Orchestration & Agent Framework**: LangChain, LangGraph
- **Observability**: LangSmith
- **Primary Language**: Python
- **LLMs**: Anthropic Claude (or other models as explicitly decided)

## 2. Salesforce Specific Tools

For interaction with Salesforce and metadata manipulation, the following (or similar, as defined in `TASK.md`) will be used:

- `simple-salesforce` (for Salesforce API interactions)
- `xmltodict` (for XML parsing and generation, especially for Flow metadata)
- Standard Python XML libraries (e.g., `xml.etree.ElementTree`)

## 3. Supporting Libraries

- `pydantic` (for data modeling and validation between agents/tools)
- `python-dotenv` (for environment variable management)
- `requests` (for direct HTTP calls if necessary)

## 4. Browser Automation (for `FlowTestAgent`)

- Libraries like Playwright or Selenium, integrated as LangChain tools.

## 5. Guiding Principle

- **Adherence**: Solutions, code generation, and architectural decisions must align with this defined stack.
- **Deviation**: Any deviation or introduction of new major technologies/tools outside this stack requires explicit discussion and approval from the USER.
- **Rationale**: This ensures consistency, maintainability, and leverages the strengths of the chosen frameworks for building this multi-agent system.
