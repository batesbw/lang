# Salesforce Solution Implementation Agent Workforce - Planning Document

## Project Overview

Building an intelligent **multi-agent workforce** using LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith. This workforce will specialize in implementing Salesforce solutions, starting with Flow configuration, deployment, and testing. The long-term vision is a collaborative group of agents capable of handling diverse Salesforce customization and development tasks.

## Core Philosophy

- **Specialization**: Each agent has a distinct role and expertise.
- **Collaboration**: Agents work together, orchestrated by LangGraph, to achieve complex goals.
- **Observability**: LangSmith will be used for tracing, debugging, and monitoring agent interactions.
- **Modularity**: Agents are designed as pluggable components.

## Agent Workforce - Current Composition

### 1. AuthenticationAgent
- **Purpose**: Handles secure authentication to specified Salesforce environments.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Autonomously authenticate using various OAuth flows.
    - Securely retrieve and manage credentials (e.g., from a vault or environment variables).
    - Provide session details (access token, instance URL) to other agents.
- **Tools**: Salesforce API client (for auth), credential management utilities.

### 2. DeploymentAgent
- **Purpose**: Performs Salesforce Metadata API operations.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Deploy and retrieve metadata packages.
    - Utilize session details from `AuthenticationAgent`.
    - Handle deployment errors and provide feedback.

### 3. FlowBuilderAgent (Enhanced)
- **Purpose**: Designs, generates, and repairs Salesforce Flow metadata XML.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Translate natural language requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria into Flow logic.
    - Leverage best practice documentation (e.g., from websites, RAG stores) and code examples.
    - Iteratively repair and refine Flow metadata based on validation, deployment, or testing feedback.
- **Tools**: RAG systems for documentation, code search tools, XML generation/manipulation libraries, LLMs for logic translation.

### 4. FlowValidationAgent
- **Purpose**: Analyzes generated Flow XML against Salesforce best practices and common errors *before* deployment.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Parses Flow XML to identify anti-patterns (e.g., DML/SOQL statements inside loops).
    - Leverages a knowledge base of common Flow errors and best practices (via RAG).
    - Provides structured, actionable feedback to `FlowBuilderAgent` for pre-emptive repairs.
- **Tools**: XML parsing libraries, RAG tools for Salesforce best practices.

### 5. TestDesignerAgent
- **Purpose**: Designs focused Apex Test Classes to validate specific acceptance criteria for Flow functionality.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Analyze acceptance criteria to identify targeted test scenarios.
    - Generate Apex Test Classes that specifically validate each acceptance criterion.
    - Create minimal test data setup methods sufficient for acceptance criteria validation.
    - Design test cases that directly map to acceptance criteria outcomes.
    - Focus on validating specific business requirements rather than comprehensive test coverage.
- **Tools**: Apex code generation utilities, Salesforce data model analysis tools, acceptance criteria analysis patterns, LLMs for targeted test scenario identification.

### 6. TestExecutorAgent
- **Purpose**: Executes Apex tests and analyzes results for comprehensive test reporting.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Deploy and execute Apex Test Classes in Salesforce orgs.
    - Monitor test execution progress and collect detailed results.
    - Analyze test failures and provide diagnostic information.
    - Generate comprehensive test reports with coverage metrics.
    - Provide feedback to other agents for test-driven development iterations.
- **Tools**: Salesforce Tooling API client, test execution monitoring tools, result analysis utilities, reporting frameworks.

### 7. FlowTestAgent
- **Purpose**: Specializes in testing Salesforce Flows against acceptance criteria.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Execute Flows within a Salesforce org via API callouts.
    - Perform UI-based Flow testing using browser automation.
    - Validate Flow behavior against provided acceptance criteria.
    - Generate test reports and provide feedback.
- **Tools**: Salesforce API client (for Apex tests, REST callouts to run Flows), browser automation frameworks (e.g., Playwright, Selenium integrated with LangChain tools), LLMs for interpreting AC and generating test assertions.

### 8. WebSearchAgent
- **Purpose**: Provides up-to-date, external information from the web to assist other agents.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Performs targeted web searches for obscure deployment errors, new Salesforce features, or API documentation.
    - Summarizes search results to provide concise, relevant information to the requesting agent (e.g., `FlowBuilderAgent`).
- **Tools**: Web search APIs (e.g., Tavily).

## Orchestration with LangGraph

LangGraph defines and manages the iterative workflow between agents. The current primary workflow for Flow creation is as follows:

1.  **Input**: User provides Flow requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and target org details.
2.  **`AuthenticationAgent`**: Obtains a session for the target org.
3.  **`FlowBuilderAgent`**: Generates the initial Flow XML based on requirements and its internal knowledge.
4.  **`FlowValidationAgent`**: Scans the generated XML for anti-patterns and errors.
    - **If issues are found**: Feedback is routed back to the `FlowBuilderAgent` for repair. The loop continues until the XML is valid.
5.  **`DeploymentAgent`**: Attempts to deploy the validated Flow.
    - **If deployment fails**: The deployment error is routed back to the `FlowBuilderAgent`. It may use the `WebSearchAgent` to research novel errors before attempting a repair. This loop continues until deployment is successful or retries are exhausted.
6.  **`TestDesignerAgent`**: (Once deployed) Analyzes requirements to generate comprehensive Apex Test Classes.
7.  **`TestExecutorAgent`**: Deploys and executes the Apex tests.
    - **If tests fail**: Results are routed back to the `FlowBuilderAgent` to repair the Flow logic. The entire build-validate-deploy-test cycle may restart.
8.  **`FlowTestAgent`**: (Future Step) Can be invoked to perform additional API or UI-level tests.
9.  **Output**: A successfully deployed and tested Flow with comprehensive test coverage, or a final report of unresolvable issues.

## Observability with LangSmith

LangSmith will be integral for:
- Tracing the execution flow across multiple agents.
- Debugging issues in agent communication and tool usage.
- Monitoring the performance and reliability of individual agents and the overall workforce.
- Collecting data for fine-tuning and improving agent performance.
- **User-Provided Context**: Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **LangChain**: Provides the foundational framework for building individual agents and their tools.
- **LangGraph**: Orchestrates the interaction and state management between agents.
- **LangSmith**: Offers observability, debugging, and monitoring.
- **LLM**: Claude (Anthropic) or other powerful models for reasoning, generation, and understanding.

### Agent Communication
- Agents will pass structured data (e.g., Pydantic models) to each other via the LangGraph state.
- Standardized error reporting and feedback mechanisms.

## Data Sources and Integration (for `FlowBuilderAgent`)
- **Salesforce Flow Documentation**: Vectorized and accessible via RAG.
- **Code Examples**: Searchable repositories of Flow XML or related Apex.
