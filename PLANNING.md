# Salesforce Solution Implementation Agent Workforce - Planning Document

## Project Overview

Building an intelligent **multi-agent workforce** using LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith. This workforce will specialize in implementing Salesforce solutions, starting with Flow configuration, deployment, and testing. The long-term vision is a collaborative group of agents capable of handling diverse Salesforce customization and development tasks.

## Core Philosophy

- **Specialization**: Each agent has a distinct role and expertise.
- **Collaboration**: Agents work together, orchestrated by LangGraph, to achieve complex goals.
- **Observability**: LangSmith will be used for tracing, debugging, and monitoring agent interactions.
- **Modularity**: Agents are designed as pluggable components.

## Agent Workforce - Initial Composition

### 1. AuthenticationAgent
- **Purpose**: Handles secure authentication to specified Salesforce environments.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Autonomously authenticate using various OAuth flows.
    - Securely retrieve and manage credentials (e.g., from a vault or environment variables).
    - Provide session details (access token, instance URL) to other agents.
- **Tools**: Salesforce API client (for auth), credential management utilities.

### 2. DeploymentAgent
- **Purpose**: Performs Salesforce Metadata API operations.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Deploy and retrieve metadata packages.
    - Utilize session details from `AuthenticationAgent`.
    - Handle deployment errors and provide feedback.
- **Tools**: Salesforce Metadata API client, file packaging utilities.

### 3. FlowBuilderAgent
- **Purpose**: Designs and generates Salesforce Flow metadata XML.

    - Translate natural language requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria into Flow logic.
    - Leverage best practice documentation (e.g., from websites, RAG stores) and code examples.
    - Iteratively repair and refine Flow metadata based on deployment or testing feedback.
- **Tools**: RAG systems for documentation, code search tools, XML generation/manipulation libraries, LLMs for logic translation.

### 4. FlowTestAgent
- **Purpose**: Specializes in testing Salesforce Flows against acceptance criteria.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Execute Flows within a Salesforce org via API callouts.
    - Perform UI-based Flow testing using browser automation.
    - Validate Flow behavior against provided acceptance criteria.
    - Generate test reports and provide feedback.
- **Tools**: Salesforce API client (for Apex tests, REST callouts to run Flows), browser automation frameworks (e.g., Playwright, Selenium integrated with LangChain tools), LLMs for interpreting AC and generating test assertions.

### 5. TestDesignerAgent
- **Purpose**: Designs comprehensive Apex Test Classes to thoroughly test Flow functionality.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Analyze user stories and acceptance criteria to identify test scenarios.
    - Generate Apex Test Classes with appropriate setup, execution, and assertion logic.
    - Create test data setup and teardown methods.
    - Design both positive and negative test cases based on business requirements.
    - Ensure test coverage for all Flow paths and business logic.
- **Tools**: Apex code generation utilities, Salesforce data model analysis tools, test pattern templates, LLMs for test scenario analysis.

### 6. TestExecutorAgent
- **Purpose**: Executes Apex tests and analyzes results for comprehensive test reporting.
- **Key Capabilities**:
    - Deploy and execute Apex Test Classes in Salesforce orgs.
    - Monitor test execution progress and collect detailed results.
    - Analyze test failures and provide diagnostic information.
    - Generate comprehensive test reports with coverage metrics.
    - Provide feedback to other agents for test-driven development iterations.
- **Tools**: Salesforce Tooling API client, test execution monitoring tools, result analysis utilities, reporting frameworks.

## Orchestration with LangGraph

LangGraph will be used to define and manage the workflows between these agents. A typical Flow creation workflow might look like:

1.  **Input**: User provides Flow requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, and target org details.
2.  **`AuthenticationAgent`**: Obtains session for the target org.
3.  **`FlowBuilderAgent`**: Generates initial Flow XML based on requirements.
4.  **`DeploymentAgent`**: Attempts to deploy the Flow using the session from `AuthenticationAgent`.
    - **If deployment fails**: Feedback (error messages) is routed back to `FlowBuilderAgent` for repair. Loop until successful deployment or max retries.
5.  **`TestDesignerAgent`**: (If deployment successful) Analyzes user stories and acceptance criteria to generate comprehensive Apex Test Classes.
6.  **`TestExecutorAgent`**: Deploys and executes the Apex tests, providing detailed results and coverage analysis.
7.  **`FlowTestAgent`**: (If Apex tests pass) Executes additional Flow tests via API and UI automation.
    - **If tests fail**: Feedback (failed assertions, logs) is routed back to `FlowBuilderAgent` for repair, or to `TestDesignerAgent` for test refinement. Loop through build-deploy-test cycle.
8.  **Output**: Successfully deployed and tested Flow with comprehensive test coverage, or a report of issues if the process cannot be completed.

## Observability with LangSmith

LangSmith will be integral for:
- Tracing the execution flow across multiple agents.
- Debugging issues in agent communication and tool usage.
- Monitoring the performance and reliability of individual agents and the overall workforce.
- Collecting data for fine-tuning and improving agent performance.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **LangChain**: Provides the foundational framework for building individual agents and their tools.
- **LangGraph**: Orchestrates the interaction and state management between agents.
- **LangSmith**: Offers observability, debugging, and monitoring.
- **LLM**: Claude (Anthropic) or other powerful models for reasoning, generation, and understanding.

### Agent Communication
- Agents will pass structured data (e.g., Pydantic models) to each other via the LangGraph state.
- Standardized error reporting and feedback mechanisms.

## Data Sources and Integration (for `FlowBuilderAgent`)
- **Salesforce Flow Documentation**: Vectorized and accessible via RAG.
- **Code Examples**: Searchable repositories of Flow XML or related Apex.
- **User-Provided Context**: Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria.
